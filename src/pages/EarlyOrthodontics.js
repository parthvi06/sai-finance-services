                                <p> Over the years we have learned that certain orthodontic conditions are more easily solved by treating them at a younger age, before all of the baby teeth have exfoliated. For example, many children present to our office with a crossbite of some or all of their teeth. We know through many growth studies that the upper jaw is very expandable and moldable before a child reaches their pubertal growth spurt, making it the ideal time to correct the issue of crossbite. Often, if the pre-pubertal treatment years are missed, we are sometimes forced to remove permanent teeth to make room to align the crowded teeth.</p>

                                    <li>The decreased risk of injury to front teeth.</li>
                                    <li>The correction of harmful oral habits, such as prolonged thumb or finger sucking.</li>
                                    <li>The reduction or elimination of abnormal swallowing or speech problems.</li>
                                    <li>An improved appearance and increased self-esteem.</li>
                                    <li>The possible simplification or shortening of treatment time for any future orthodontics treatment</li>    
                                    <li>A reduced likelihood of impacted permanent teeth.</li>
                                    <li>An increased space for the eruption of permanent teeth.</li>
                                    <li>Reduction of airway disturbance, including snoring and sleep apnea (snoring in a child is not a normal finding).</li>
                                    <li>A reduced likelihood of damage to the roots of some permanent teeth, as other permanent teeth try to grow in around them.</li>

                                <p><br />Early orthodontic evaluations help identify patients who would benefit from a Phase One treatment. If a first phase treatment is performed, it tends to make comprehensive treatment later on faster and more effective.</p>

                                <p>Global demand for orthodontics without braces continues to grow. Itâ€™s an option that many parents and patients would prefer.<br />
                                    Myofunctional orthodontics offers a viable alternative to traditional orthodontic methods<br />
                                    A functional appliance is an appliance that produces all or part of its effect by altering the position of the mandible/ maxilla<br /> These appliances use the muscle action of the patient to produce orthodontic or orthopedic forces to restore facial balance.<br />

                                <p>During your child&#39;s examination, we will determine if there are any problems that need attention,
                                such as potential crowding, an open bite, overbite, crossbite or gummy smile. Not every child
                                will need immediate treatment, in fact the majority of our patients do not need any early
                                interceptive treatment. If a need for treatment is indicated, we will create a personalized
                                treatment plan for the child based on their specific needs.</p>
