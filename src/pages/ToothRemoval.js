                                <p>At Kidsville Dental, the pediatric dentist has her own style of talking to children about teeth removal. Just don’t prepare them at all. In doing so you may transfer your own anxiety onto the child. We don’t want you to be anxious at all. We encourage you to not mention the word “injection” while talking to your child even at home.  This helps us manage your child’s fear better. </p>
