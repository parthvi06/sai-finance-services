                                    <p>You should begin to care about your child’s oral hygiene from his infancy itself. Ask your pedodontist for the detailed manner to do so. Schedule your child’s first dental appointment before their first birthday or after his or her first baby tooth is visible, whichever comes first.</p>
                                    <p>As kids grow up, their oral hygiene habits should grow with them. Kids have all their baby teeth by the age of 3. These are called primary teeth. Baby teeth start falling out around age 6; that’s when the permanent, or adult, teeth start coming in. Gaps between baby teeth are normal. They make room for permanent teeth. Most permanent teeth come in by age 13.</p>

                                    <p>Cavities (also known as caries or tooth decay) are one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Untreated cavities can cause pain and infections that may lead to problems with eating, speaking, playing, and learning. Children who have poor oral health often <strong>miss more school and receive lower grades than children who don’t.</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>About 1 of 5 (20%) children aged 5 to 11 years have at least one untreated decayed tooth.</li>
                                        <li>1 of 7 (13%) adolescents aged 12 to 19 years have at least one untreated decayed tooth.</li>
                                        <li>Children aged 5 to 19 years from low-income families are twice as likely (25%) to have cavities, compared with children from higher-income households (11%).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The good news is that cavities are preventable. Fluoride varnish can prevent about one-third (33%) of cavities in the primary (baby) teeth.2 Children living in communities with fluoridated tap water have fewer cavities than children whose water is not fluoridated.3 Similarly, children who brush daily with fluoride toothpaste will have fewer cavities.</p>
                                    <p>Dental sealants can also prevent cavities for many years. Applying dental sealants to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth prevent 80% of cavities.</p>
