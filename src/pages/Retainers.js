                                <h2>WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GET A RETAINER?</h2>
                                <p>A retainer keeps your teeth from moving after they’ve been straightened with braces. It can take at least<strong> four to six months </strong>for the new position of your teeth to become permanent. During that time, your teeth will try to shift back to their original position, which is called relapse. When used as instructed, a retainer prevents this from happening.</p>

                                <h2 className="text-center">What Are Retainers?</h2>
                                <p>Retainers are pieces of plastic or metal that are custom-made for each person. No two retainers are the same. They’re made to match the shape of your mouth and the alignment of your teeth.</p>
                                <p>There are two general kinds of retainers:</p>
                                <p><strong>Removable:</strong>These can be put in and taken out daily by your child. They can be wire retainers (made of wire and a plastic-like material) or clear retainers (transparent trays made of a plastic-like material).</p>
                                <p><strong>Fixed:</strong>These are made of thin, custom-fitted wire that is bonded to the tongue-side of your child’s upper or lower teeth.</p>
                                <h3>Why Do We Wear Dental Retainers?</h3>
                                <p>So, what are retainers for? Your child might need a retainer for multiple reasons.<br/> Retainers are most commonly needed after braces come off so that the bone that holds the teeth can rebuild after the teeth have moved. Retainers also help to maintain the new positions of teeth after active orthodontic treatment has been completed.</p>
                                <p>In some other cases, your child’s orthodontist may recommend a retainer to move a single tooth or to close a space between two teeth. In these cases, braces aren’t typically needed, and your child may need to wear a retainer for several years to get the job done.</p>
                                <p>Retainers are useful for reasons other than shifting teeth. Some kids have a tongue thrust (a condition where the tongue slides through the teeth when you talk). Some retainers can be specially designed to train your tongue not to move forward when you speak.</p>
                                <p>Retainers can also keep children with <strong>temporomandibular disorder (TMD), resulting from bruxism (grinding of the teeth)</strong>. Retainers can help by preventing your child’s jaw from closing completely at night so that they won’t grind their teeth.</p>

                                <h3>Hawley's Retainer</h3>
                                <p>Also called wire retainers, these are removable retainers made of thin metal wire and plastic or acrylic shaped to fit the roof of your mouth or along the inside of your lower teeth. The attached metal wire runs across the outside of your teeth to maintain alignment.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Hawley retainer has these advantages:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The retainer can be adjusted if you need a better fit when you first get it or if your teeth need slight realignment later.</li>
                                    <li>It’s slightly more durable than a clear plastic retainer.</li>
                                    <li>It may be repairable if broken.</li>
                                    <li>It can last for years if used and cared for properly.</li>
                                    <li>The upper and lower teeth touch naturally with this type of retainer.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Disadvantages of Hawley's Retainer:</strong></p>

                                    <li>It affects your speech more than other retainers.</li>
                                    <li>It’s more noticeable than the other types of retainers.</li>
                                    <li>The wire may irritate your lip or cheeks initially.</li>

                                <h3>Clear Plastic Retainer</h3>
                                <p>These are removable retainers that are molded to perfectly fit the new position of your teeth. They’re also called molded retainers. (The technical name for them is thermoplastic or vacuum-formed retainers.)</p>
                                <p>To make this type of retainer, a mold of the teeth is created. A very thin plastic or polyurethane is then heated and sucked down around the mold.</p>
                                <p><strong>A clear plastic retainer has these advantages:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It’s virtually invisible, so you’re more likely to wear it. That means relapse is less likely.</li>
                                    <li>It’s less bulky and may be more comfortable than a Hawley retainer.</li>
                                    <li>It’s less likely to affect your speech than a Hawley retainer.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Disadvantages of a clear retainer:</strong></p>

                                    <li>It can’t be adjusted if you need realignment. It would need to be replaced.</li>
                                    <li>If it cracks or breaks, it can’t be repaired.</li>
                                    <li>It may affect your speech more than permanent retainers.</li>
                                    <li>It can warp if exposed to heat.</li>
                                    <li>It tends to become discolored (and more visible) over time.</li>
                                    <li>Top and bottom teeth don’t touch naturally with this type of retainer.</li>
                                    <li>It can trap liquids against your teeth, which can cause cavities.</li>

                                <p><strong>Permanent retainers </strong>consist of a solid or braided wire that is curved to fit the shape of your newly straightened teeth. The wire is cemented (bonded) to the inside of your front teeth to keep them from moving. Most often used on lower teeth, they are also called fixed, lingual wire, or bonded retainers. They can’t be removed except by your orthodontist or dentist.</p>
                                <p>•	They’re often used when an orthodontist thinks the teeth are very likely to relapse or the person (such as a young child) won’t follow the instructions for using a removable retainer. Although some are removed at some point, usually because of excess buildup of plaque and tarter or gum irritation, most are left in place indefinitely</p>

                                <p>Even after your teeth have successfully moved to a new position, the effects of eating, chewing and everyday wear can cause relapse. Retainers prevent this relapse and allow bone formation around the teeth and safeguarding the effects of treatment. If you have been prescribed a removable retainer, it’s important that you wear it exactly according to your orthodontist’s instructions or you may lose some or all benefits of the braces. You should see your orthodontist in case you lose your retainer, it cracks or breaks.</p>
