                        <h2>What we did:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New COVID-19 practice policy is implemented and all clinicians follow guidance on COVID-19 by <a href="https://www.aapd.org/about/about-aapd/news-room/covid-19/"> https://www.aapd.org/about/about-aapd/news-room/covid-19/</a></li>
                            <li>A new telephone script is implemented to screen for potential symptoms/concerns before the appointment</li>
                            <li>A notice board is at the reception states the information on COVID-19. All patients can read/screen symptoms before the appointment</li>
                            <li>Hand sanitizers are available for you at any time</li>
                            <li>All commonly used areas are wiped with disinfectant thoroughly at least twice a day. These include all door handles around the reception, play area, lift buttons, card machines, etc.</li>
                            <li>All non-essentials (magazines, soft toys, iPads) are removed from the waiting areas to reduce the cross-contamination risk</li>
                            <li>We provide masks for the patients who request a face mask</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>What can you do?</h2>
                        <p>Of course, you - our fantastic patients – can help enormously. We don’t want to preach about maintaining good personal hygiene, everyone has heard enough of that already! However, other small things can really help too. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wash hands thoroughly immediately when you come to the clinic and after your appointment;</li>
                            <li>Please complete booking appointment, to reduce your waiting time.</li>
                            <li>If you’ve been exposed to someone you know to have COVID-19 symptoms, be cautious and self-isolate for the recommended period;</li>
                            <li>Look after your immune system by eating and drinking sensibly during this outbreak</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Friends, family and community spirit are critical at times like this. As we rise to this challenge, we thank you for your understanding and support!</p>
                        <p>As social distancing is still very much applicable, we would like to take this opportunity to brief you on some of the changes that might affect your appointments:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not bring additional family members/siblings unless necessary.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the procedure you might be asked to sit further away from the dental chair than normal.</li>
                            <li>If certain aerosol-generating procedures (AGPS) ie, using the drill (for procedures such as fillings, pulp treatments), machine cleaning, and laughing gas sedation are to be avoided, the dentist will discuss alternative treatment plans with you.</li>
                            <li>Limitations on the number of appointments available to allow social distancing between patients.</li>
                            <li>Longer appointments will be offered to complete as many treatments as possible during one visit.</li>
                            <li>Patients with any health underlying conditions will be offered special appointment slots, like early morning or late afternoon to eliminate the risks of contamination.</li>
                            <li>Routine screening will be carried out including forms to be filled in online before you attend, you will be questioned on arrival, and your temperature may be taken.</li>
                            <li>You may be asked to wear a mask and shoe cover during your child's appointment that will be provided by us.</li>
                            <li>You may see that our waiting rooms will no longer offer magazines, children’s toys, and so forth since those items are difficult to clean and disinfect.</li>
                            <li>We will do our best to allow greater time between patients to reduce waiting times for you, as well as to reduce the number of patients in the reception area at any one time.</li>
                            <li>It would be beneficial to prepare your child in advance that the dental team may not look ‘’normal’’ as they will have PPE on. Perhaps you could say they will be dressed up as astronauts or robots!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>We hope to return to normal working conditions at the earliest and will keep you updated along the way.<br /> Thank you for being our patient, we appreciate your loyalty and understanding!</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>We have established protocols, risk assessments, acquired extra personal protection equipment (PPE) and have updated infection prevention protocols in line with latest available COVID-19 guidance and standard operating procedures.</strong></p>
