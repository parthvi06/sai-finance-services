                                <p>Invisalign treatment differs from traditional non-removable metal brackets because Invisalign comprises a set of a few transparent, custom-moulded clear aligners, which can be removed for up to 2 hours each day. This allows for more freedom in any busy teenager’s lifestyle. Invisalign Teen also has a few special features, designed specifically for teenagers:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Invisalign Teen comes with blue wear-indicators. These fade from blue to clear on each clear aligner to help you, your orthodontist and your teenager themselves to gauge wear over time.</li>
                                    <li>Six free replacement aligners are included (in case any get lost or misplaced, e.g. when playing sports).</li>
                                    <li>Invisalign Teen aligners have special features designed to guide the growth of new teeth (canines, second premolars and second molars), helping them to get to a planned, straighter position.</li>

Experienced orthodontists like Dr. Ipsit will also be able to easily detect issues with spacing, crowding, bite, and alignment in this age range, and the bone and jaw structure are formed enough to allow orthodontic treatment to begin.

It may surprise you to learn, however, that the braces of today are far smaller and sleeker than their past incarnations. They’re lighter, more comfortable, and also easily customized by choosing from many colors of elastic ties on the brackets.</p>

                                <p>Also known as clear braces, these work the same way metal braces do, but feature brackets made of tooth-colored ceramic materials which blend in with your teen’s own smile, making them much less obvious. Since ceramic braces are slightly more prone to breakage, and a little costlier than metal braces, they may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

                                <p>Damon passive self-ligating braces are similar to traditional older metal braces, but rather than tying a tight elastic or metal ligature around the brace to hold in the wire, they use a gentle sliding door to secure the wire. The passive door allows the wire of the braces to slide back and forth within the bracket to provide less friction, greater comfort, and the same effective treatment often in less time than traditional braces. Although these types of braces do not use the colored ties to hold the wire, we can still place the colors around these braces if a patient wishes as a fun way to personalize their smile.<br />
                                <br />Clear Damon braces work the same way as metal braces described above, however they are made out of a very high quality ceramic material that blends in better with the natural color of the teeth. Unlike older clear braces, the Damon Clear braces do not stain or take on the color of dark foods and beverages.</p>

These systems are made up of a series of customized, clear trays called aligners that are near invisible and removable. Made of a thin plastic material, clear aligners provide a more comfortable fit over the teeth, with no friction or abrasions inside the mouth. Each aligner is changed out every 7-14 days, at which time the next aligner is inserted to continue moving the teeth. When worn the recommended 20-22 hours per day, the teeth will gradually move into the desired positions. Clear aligner therapy is not ideal for every type of bite problem. We will be happy to provide a complimentary consultation to review each new patient’s unique bite issues and discuss all of the pertinent treatment options.</p>

However, treatment often progresses faster and with less discomfort during the teenage years as compared to the treatment of during adulthood. Additionally, it is our belief that when the teeth are put into the proper position while the body is still growing and malleable, the jaw bones will finish their maturation and hardening around the teeth ideally positioned. Greater stability over the long term is expected with fewer post-treatment changes.</p>

                                <p>Orthodontics is not merely for improving the aesthetics of the smile; orthodontic treatment improves improper bites. These occur as a result of tooth or jaw misalignment. It affects the way you smile, chew, clean your teeth or feel about your smile.</p>

                                <h3>How long does treatment take?</h3>
                                <p>This is a question with no concrete answer, unfortunately! Every case is different, but on average, the active stage of orthodontic treatment will last anywhere from 6-36 months. After this phase of treatment is complete, your teen will need to wear a retainer for as long as Dr. Ipsit feels is necessary based on their individual case. We work as a team with both parents and teens to create the kind of smile that will last a lifetime.</p>

                                <p>Absolutely! If your teen athlete is wearing more traditional braces, it will be essential to protect their smile in order to keep on track with treatment. We strongly recommend that they use an orthodontic mouthguard to protect their braces, and their mouth, from any potential injury. With the use of a proper orthodontic mouthguard, any contact sport can be played with braces.</p>
                                <p>Because Invisalign aligners are removable, teens using this system can simply take their aligner out before practice or a game, and put it back in afterwards.</p>

                                <p>Traditional metal braces can potentially affect the way your teen plays some instruments. Invisalign is an excellent alternative treatment, as removing the aligner before playing allows complete freedom for your teen’s music-making abilities!</p>
                                <p>Orthodontic treatment is truly an investment in your child’s future. By scheduling a consultation, Dr. Ipsit will be happy to discuss the benefits of treatment with both of you, as well as any of the potential risks associated with delaying or foregoing treatment. Although adults can, and do, successfully complete orthodontic treatment, the jaws and teeth of teenagers often respond more quickly to orthodontic treatment, shortening their total treatment time.</p>

                                    <p>Traditional braces are comprised of brackets that are affixed to teeth and wires that are threaded through slots in the brackets. Some patients may also have metal bands encircling back teeth. Wires are held to brackets by tiny rubber bands called “ligatures” or “o-rings.” Brackets are generally made of stainless steel.  Wires are made of metal alloys and deliver a constant, gentle force to move teeth.</p>

                                    <p>Aligners are clear, thin, plastic-like trays that are formed to fit an individual’s teeth. Patients are responsible for putting in and removing their aligners. A series of aligners is created to move teeth. Each aligner is worn for 2-3 weeks, and moves teeth a fraction of a millimeter at a time. Patients must remove aligners for meals and when brushing/flossing. The number of aligners needed to correct misaligned teeth varies based on the individual’s orthodontic problem and its correction.</p>

                                <p>Maintaining excellent oral health habits is encouraged and expected no matter the patient’s age, but is even more important during orthodontic treatment. For patients with braces, the brackets and wires can make brushing and flossing a challenge. Without excellent oral hygiene, plaque and food can accumulate around braces, forming bacteria that lead to cavities or even gum disease. If plaque accumulates around the braces, it can leave permanent stains on teeth called decalcification. Periodontal disease is caused by a buildup of this same plaque that starts forming below the surface of the gums, in the pocket surrounding the teeth.</p>
                                <p>Even though early gum disease is reversible with professional help and careful attention at home, it can get worse if it i’s ignored. Complications can be avoided by taking good care of the braces. It requires a little extra work to keep braces squeaky clean, but as with anything, practice makes perfect. By understanding the best way to brush with braces, and developing a good oral hygiene routine, the completion of the treatment will result in straight and healthy teeth.</p>

                                    <li>Brush teeth thoroughly 3 times per day with fluoride toothpaste, especially after meals and before bed. Pay close attention to the areas between brackets and gums, carefully cleaning between the wires and teeth. Brush for at least two minutes each time, placing the tips of the bristles against the teeth, and firmly using small circular motions. Do not be afraid to scrub diligently to get rid of the plaque.</li>
                                    <li>Use a soft orthodontic toothbrush, or an electric toothbrush with a soft bristled head. Interdental brushes can also be used to fit in between the wires and the teeth and remove hard-to-reach plaque and food debris. A mouthwash containing fluoride should be used in addition to regular brushing and flossing to help strengthen the enamel.</li>
                                    <li>Flossing is an essential part of maintaining healthy teeth and gums, and should be done at least once per day. Flossing regularly is even more important when wearing braces because it is easy for food particles to get stuck in the tiny crevices around the brackets and in the gums.</li>
                                    <li>A floss threader is a tool designed to help make flossing with braces easier. It ’is a little bit like a threading needle — pull one end of the floss through the threader, feed the threader under the archwire, grab the floss on each end and slide it up and down the sides of both teeth and under the gums.</li>
                                    <li>Oral irrigators like a Waterpik should also be used in addition to regular brushing and flossing. These instruments are able to shoot small, high-pressure streams of water onto the teeth, removing food debris and plaque from between the teeth and braces</li>
