                                <p>Frequently started between the ages of 12 and 16, since most permanent teeth will be in place, the teen years are the most common time for orthodontic treatment. Experienced orthodontists like Dr. Ipsit will also be able to easily detect issues with spacing, crowding, bite, and alignment in this age range, and the bone and jaw structure are formed enough to allow orthodontic treatment to begin. Some teens may have even started Phase I treatment at an earlier age, and are now following it up with full braces or other orthodontic treatment.</p>

                                <p>The most popular and well-known orthodontic appliance, traditional metal braces hardly need an introduction! It may surprise you to learn, however, that the braces of today are far smaller and sleeker than their past incarnations. They’re lighter, more comfortable, and also easily customized by choosing from many colors of elastic ties on the brackets.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Also known as clear braces, these work the same way metal braces do, but feature brackets made of tooth-colored ceramic materials which blend in with your teen’s own smile, making them much less obvious. Since ceramic braces are slightly more prone to breakage, and a little costlier than metal braces, they may not be suitable for everyone.</p>

                                <p>Damon passive self-ligating braces are similar to traditional older metal braces, but rather than tying a tight elastic or metal ligature around the brace to hold in the wire, they use a gentle sliding door to secure the wire. The passive door allows the wire of the braces to slide back and forth within the bracket to provide less friction, greater comfort, and the same effective treatment often in less time than traditional braces. Although these types of braces do not use the colored ties to hold the wire, we can still place the colors around these braces if a patient wishes as a fun way to personalize their smile.<br />
                                <br />Clear Damon braces work the same way as metal braces described above, however they are made out of a very high quality ceramic material that blends in better with the natural color of the teeth. Unlike older clear braces, the Damon Clear braces do not stain or take on the color of dark foods and beverages.</p>

These systems are made up of a series of customized, clear trays called aligners that are near invisible and removable. Made of a thin plastic material, clear aligners provide a more comfortable fit over the teeth, with no friction or abrasions inside the mouth. Each aligner is changed out every 7-14 days, at which time the next aligner is inserted to continue moving the teeth. When worn the recommended 20-22 hours per day, the teeth will gradually move into the desired positions. Clear aligner therapy is not ideal for every type of bite problem. We will be happy to provide a complimentary consultation to review each new patient’s unique bite issues and discuss all of the pertinent treatment options.</p>

                                <p>The rapid changes an adolescent experiences physically during puberty is a benefit when it comes to orthodontic treatments. By taking advantage of the pubertal growth spurts, we are able to use growth to our advantage to help direct jaw growth, correcting even severe bite relationships.</p>
                                <p>The benefits of straight, well-aligned teeth that are a result of respond well to orthodontic treatment include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Teeth that are less prone to wear, chipping, and tooth trauma.</li>
                                    <li>Teeth that are easier to keep clean, which helps prevent tooth decay and cavities.</li>
                                    <li>Less of a chance to develop gum (periodontal) disease.</li>
                                    <li>The improvement of proper chewing and digestion of food.</li>
                                    <li>Excellent esthetics and sometimes improvement in ones self-esteem.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Orthodontic therapy can be performed at any age. However, treatment often progresses faster and with less discomfort during the teenage years as compared to the treatment of during adulthood. Additionally, it is our belief that when the teeth are put into the proper position while the body is still growing and malleable, the jaw bones will finish their maturation and hardening around the teeth ideally positioned. Greater stability over the long term is expected with fewer post-treatment changes.</p>

Every case is different, but on average, the active stage of orthodontic treatment will last anywhere from 6-36 months. After this phase of treatment is complete, your teen will need to wear a retainer for as long as Dr. Ipsit feels is necessary based on their individual case. We work as a team with both parents and teens to create the kind of smile that will last a lifetime.</p>

                                <h2 className="text-center">Brushing and flossing with braces</h2>
                                <p>Maintaining excellent oral health habits is encouraged and expected no matter the patient’s age, but is even more important during orthodontic treatment. For patients with braces, the brackets and wires can make brushing and flossing a challenge. Without excellent oral hygiene, plaque and food can accumulate around braces, forming bacteria that lead to cavities or even gum disease. If plaque accumulates around the braces, it can leave permanent stains on teeth called decalcification. Periodontal disease is caused by a buildup of this same plaque that starts forming below the surface of the gums, in the pocket surrounding the teeth.</p>
                                <p>Even though early gum disease is reversible with professional help and careful attention at home, it can get worse if it i’s ignored. Complications can be avoided by taking good care of the braces. It requires a little extra work to keep braces squeaky clean, but as with anything, practice makes perfect. By understanding the best way to brush with braces, and developing a good oral hygiene routine, the completion of the treatment will result in straight and healthy teeth.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Brush teeth thoroughly 3 times per day with fluoride toothpaste, especially after meals and before bed. Pay close attention to the areas between brackets and gums, carefully cleaning between the wires and teeth. Brush for at least two minutes each time, placing the tips of the bristles against the teeth, and firmly using small circular motions. Do not be afraid to scrub diligently to get rid of the plaque.</li>
                                    <li>Use a soft orthodontic toothbrush, or an electric toothbrush with a soft bristled head. Interdental brushes can also be used to fit in between the wires and the teeth and remove hard-to-reach plaque and food debris. A mouthwash containing fluoride should be used in addition to regular brushing and flossing to help strengthen the enamel.</li>
                                    <li>Flossing is an essential part of maintaining healthy teeth and gums, and should be done at least once per day. Flossing regularly is even more important when wearing braces because it is easy for food particles to get stuck in the tiny crevices around the brackets and in the gums.</li>
                                    <li>A floss threader is a tool designed to help make flossing with braces easier. It ’is a little bit like a threading needle — pull one end of the floss through the threader, feed the threader under the archwire, grab the floss on each end and slide it up and down the sides of both teeth and under the gums.</li>
                                    <li>Oral irrigators like a Waterpik should also be used in addition to regular brushing and flossing. These instruments are able to shoot small, high-pressure streams of water onto the teeth, removing food debris and plaque from between the teeth and braces</li>
