                                <p>As parents you are anxious about your child’s dental visit and we totally get it. But we want you to relax and walk through the journey with us. We at Kidsville have our unique way and here is how.</p>
                                <p>Just taking the time to familiarize your child to the new environment can go a long way in establishing a liking for dental procedures. The doctor will have her own style of introducing the set up to the young patient. It may involve giving funny names to instruments and equipments and even reintroducing common materials cartoonishly.</p>
                                <p>Just by working away the <strong>“anxiety “component of pain </strong>, can help leaps and bounds in delivering optimum care. For this we want all our parents to not project their fear related to dentistry onto Kids by discussing procedures at home.</p>

                                <p>We do not encourage parents to instill any fear for the word <strong>“injection”</strong> as a means of punishment at home or otherwise. Children pick their parent’s emotions subconsciously. It would be great if all parents relaxed and maintained composure all through the dental visits. In fact expressing a bit of excitement can pump up children for what’s to come.</p>
                                <p>There is barely any component of<strong> “pain”</strong> to deal with in reality. Very minimal discomfort that the child could possibly feel is also taken care of beforehand and his journey made smooth.</p>

                                <p>We reward all good behavior and work on eliminating all disrupting behavior. We do this by going to the level of child’s understanding.</p>
                                <p>Our pace of completing the procedure will be, whatever is comfortable to the child. We work WITH children not ON them. We introduce treatment in phases, increasing the complexity of procedures only when we are sure that the child is ready for it. Our appointments are based on multiple factors which we feel in our opinion is best for him</p>
                                <p>We may ask parents to cooperate in the process of behavior management. We may ask you to not actively communicate with the child while he is being treated and stay passive, allowing our team to subtly execute our techniques. On certain occasions, we may ask parents to wait out in the reception to successfully use <strong>“parental separation” </strong>as a scientifically proven and impactful technique.</p>
                                <p>We will love your child, spoil your child and we may even be strict with your child. We have our well experienced, scientific and tactful ways of treating children.</p>

                                <p>And finally for those of our kids who are just unable to cope up with dentistry despite all measures, we have a robust team of super specialist doctors to render treatment under sedation or General Anesthesia, which are more known as pharmacologic behavior management techniques.</p>
                                <p>We encourage parents to trust the process and relax and take a sip of coffee, while we take care of their children’s oral issues.</p>
