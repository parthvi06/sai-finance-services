                        <h2>What is orthodontic treatment?</h2>
                        <p>Orthodontic treatment commonly uses fixed or removable braces to treat misalignment of the teeth or jaws, or sometimes both. Common problems that are corrected by an orthodontist include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Crooked teeth</li>
                            <li>Protruding front teeth</li>
                            <li>Crossbites</li>
                            <li>Cessation of habits, like thumb sucking and correcting the bite once this has stopped.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Another key aspect of orthodontic treatment is managing the development of the teeth. This means making sure all the teeth are present, in the right location at the right time, and developing normally. If not, then an orthodontist will often make recommendations or plan treatment to ensure development is normal.</p>

                                <p>The best age to receive your first orthodontic consultation is typically around age seven. It’s important for an orthodontist to evaluate all children initially by this age, whether they end up needing treatment or not. <br />This is the time in a child’s life when their adult teeth start to come out to replace the primary (baby) teeth. And, it is around this time when the vast majority of orthodontic issues can be identified.</p>
                                <p><strong>In addition to an intraoral evaluation of the child’s dentition, the orthodontist can order imaging,including 3D imaging, to see:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How the upper (maxilla) and lower (mandible) jaws are forming</li>
                                    <li>If the teeth are erupting in a good position or proper alignment</li>
                                    <li>If there are any impacted teeth (common with first molars)</li>
                                    <li>If there is an ectopic canine (usually an upper eye tooth that is growing horizontally in the upper jaw)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Not every seven-year-old will need early orthodontic treatment. After the evaluation, the orthodontist may tell you that there are no issues to worry about or that there are minor ones that the doctor can monitor. However, it’s always good to get that early look in order to know what the future holds for your child’s orthodontic needs!</p>
                                <p>The reason age seven is the best age to receive an initial orthodontic evaluation is that it’s the easiest time to identify problems. The teeth are just beginning to erupt, so braces can be utilized, if needed,  to make minor adjustments to guide the teeth into proper alignment.</p>
                                <p>It’s easier to fix these problems in children than it is in adults because a child’s jawbones are still developing. An adult’s jaw bones are dense, which means it takes longer to realign the teeth and address any jaw issues. The upper palate can only be expanded until about the age of 9, at which point the sutures fuse. It is much more difficult to widen the arch in adult patients.</p>
                                <p>Achieving proper alignment is easier and less costly if you invest in early orthodontic treatment. Children can take between six months and two years to complete treatment, while adults can take anywhere from 10 months to two years. (Thankfully, with the latest technology, this time frame can be reduced significantly.)</p>

                                    Many people have crowded or crooked teeth. Orthodontic treatment will straighten the teeth or move them into a better position. This can improve their appearance and the way the teeth bite together, while also making them easier to clean.<br />
                                    <br />Some people have upper front teeth that stick out and look unsightly. These 'prominent' teeth are more likely to be damaged, but orthodontic treatment can move them back into line. Or the way the upper and lower jaws meet can cause teeth to look unsightly and lead to an incorrect bite. Orthodontic treatment may be able to correct both of these problems.<br />
                                    <br />When the teeth don't meet correctly, this can put strain on the muscles of the jaw, causing jaw and joint problems and sometimes headaches. Orthodontic treatment can help you to bite more evenly and reduce the strain.

                                        The best time is generally during childhood, but adults can have orthodontic treatment too - and more and more are doing so. Age is less important than having the right number of teeth. In children it may be necessary to wait for enough teeth to come through before starting treatment.

                                    The most important thing is to have a full examination. This will usually involve looking at your teeth, taking <strong>dental x-rays</strong> and making plaster models of your teeth.<br />

                                    Often, teeth need to be guided more accurately than they can be using a removable brace. So a fixed brace is used. This has brackets and bands which are temporarily stuck to the teeth. A flexible wire joins all the brackets and allows the teeth to be moved. You can't take the appliance out yourself, so it is called a fixed appliance.

                                    They are tough, clear plastic 'aligners' (moulds) that are used to straighten teeth. Several sets of specially moulded, slightly different aligners are made for each patient. Each set is worn for two weeks before being replaced with the next one. They are made from clear plastic, so they are nearly invisible. This means that no one need know you are straightening your teeth.<br />
                                    <br />The aligners should be worn for 22 to 23 hours a day for the best results. They can be easily removed for eating, drinking, brushing, and for cleaning in between your teeth. You need to have all your adult teeth before you can have this treatment.

                                    Your teeth can be damaged if you don't look after them properly during treatment. The braces themselves will not cause damage, but poor cleaning and too many sugary foods and drinks can cause permanent damage to your teeth. Brackets, wires and braces can trap food and cause more plaque than usual to build up. So you need to clean your teeth and appliance very thoroughly.

Braces are delicate and you need to make sure you clean them carefully so that they do not break. Your dental team will be able to show you the special techniques to use depending on the appliance you are wearing.</li>
                                        <li>Cut down on how often you have sugary foods and drinks. Avoid snacks and drinks containing sugars, and fizzy drinks. Also, sticky and hard foods may damage your brace.</li>
                                        <li>Brush your teeth last thing at night and at least one other time during the day. Use a mouthwash if you need to. Your dental team may recommend a stronger <strong>fluoride toothpaste</strong>, or perhaps a fluoride gel or mouth rinse, for you to use.</li>
