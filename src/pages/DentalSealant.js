                                <p>A sealant is a protective plastic coating, which is applied to the biting surfaces of the back teeth. The sealant forms a hard shield that keeps food and bacteria from getting into the tiny grooves in the teeth and causing decay.</p>

                                <p>Sealants are only applied to the back teeth – the molars and premolars. These are the teeth that have ‘pits’ (small hollows) and ‘fissures’ (grooves) on their biting surfaces. Some teeth naturally have deep grooves which will need to be sealed; others have shallow ones which will not need sealing.</p>

                                <p>Sealants are often applied as soon as the first permanent teeth start to come through. This is usually between 6 and 7 years of age. The rest are usually sealed as soon as they appear which can be any time between 11 and 14 years of age.</p>   
                                <p>The sooner the sealants are in place, the less opportunity the oral bacteria will have to build up.</p>
                                <p>However, sealants are still beneficial, even when applied later on. So, the treatment comes highly recommended for older children too.</p>
