                                <p>As a parent, <strong>if your child sucks his thumb, uses a pacifier, and/or sucks on his fingers or a favorite object,</strong> you probably have some concerns about what the consequences of these habits may be for his or her teeth and jaws as he grows.<br />
                                    <br /><strong>At Kidsville Pediatric Dentistry,</strong> we address concerns about oral habits compassionately and knowledgeably with both you and your child. Depending on your child’s age, dental and orthodontic options are available both to stop these oral habits and treat the malocclusion (misalignment of teeth) caused by the habit. The malocclusion most often created by these habits is called <strong>“open bite.”</strong><br/>
                                    <br />Oral habits in children are completely normal forms of self-soothing and exploration of the environment under age four. However, daily oral habits also tend to cause<strong> protrusion of upper jaw and a narrowing of the palate.</strong></p>

                                <h2 className="text-center">How Do Oral Habits Cause Problems?</h2>
                                <p>Prolonged thumb-sucking may cause teeth to become misaligned or push the front teeth outward. This usually corrects itself when your child stops thumb-sucking. However, the longer thumb- sucking and/or other oral habits continue, the more likely it becomes that orthodontic treatment will be needed.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Anterior open bite is a condition in which there is no overlap between the opposing front teeth when the teeth are biting together. This often occurs if your child has engaged in frequent and intense thumb-sucking and/or prolonged chewing on an object.</li>
                                    <li>Speech problems caused by oral habits can include: the inability to say <strong>‘T’s and ‘D’s; lisping; and thrusting out</strong> the tongue while speaking.</li>
                                    <li>It&#39;s normal and healthy for infants to suck their thumbs, fingers, pacifiers, or toys. Object sucking gives children a sense of emotional security and comfort.But if thumb sucking continues beyond the age of 5, when the permanent teeth begin to come in, dental problems can occur.Depending on the frequency, intensity, and duration of the sucking, the teeth can be pushed out of alignment, causing them to protrude and create an overbite. Your child may also have difficulty with the correct pronunciation of words. In addition, the upper and lower jaws can become misaligned and the roof of the mouth might become malformed.</li>

                                <p>The American Association of Orthodontists recommends all children be evaluated by an orthodontic professional at age seven. An early evaluation is critical to monitor growth patterns as well as mitigating further problems.</p>

                                    <li>If your child maintains his/her oral habits by age four or older, it’s wise to tell your pediatric dentist and make sure he/she is aware of the habit.</li>
                                    <li>The earlier your child has an orthodontic evaluation, the lower his risk of an improper bite, lisp, and possible difficulty chewing.</li>
                                    <li>One benefit of early orthodontic attention to open bite is that early intervention may reduce subsequent orthodontic treatment time.</li>

                                <p>If your child needs a device to stop his or her sucking habits, pediatric dentists and orthodontists may recommend a habit appliance. Various orthodontic appliances which can be used to break the thumb-sucking habit</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Also known as a palatal crib/rakes, this fixed appliance is cemented onto your child’s upper palate (the roof of his mouth) by an orthodontist. A palatal crib consists of semicircular stainless steel wires that are fastened to your child’s molars using steel bands. This type of <strong>“interceptive” </strong>appliance immediately discourages what doctors call<strong> “non-nutritive sucking”</strong> — so that if braces are necessary, duration of treatment will be horter for your child.</li>
                                    <li>Blue grass appliances- consist of modified six sided roller machined from Teflon to permit purchase of the tongue</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quad helix</strong> prevents the thumb from being inserted and also corrects the malocclusion by expanding the arch</li>

                                    <li>Some orthodontists believe that in many children’s cases, it is better to wait until all a child’s baby teeth have been lost to treat an open bite; because as children age, the top and bottom rows of front teeth tend progressively to grow closer to each other.</li>
                                    <li>Various types of brackets and elastics work to gradually close a child’s open bite; so you and your child can discuss the best option for his situation with your orthodontist.</li>

                                <h2 className="text-center">Tips to Help Your Child Stop Thumb Sucking</h2>
                                <p>First, remember that thumb sucking is normal and should not be a concern unless the habit continues as the permanent teeth begin to emerge.</p>
                                <p>Children must make the decision on their own to stop sucking their thumb or fingers before the habit will cease. To help toward this goal, parents and family members can offer encouragement and positive reinforcement. Because thumb sucking is a security mechanism, negative reinforcement (such as scolding, nagging, or punishments) are generally ineffective; they make children defensive and drive them back to the habit. Instead, give praise or rewards for time successfully avoiding the habit. Gradually increase the time needed without sucking to achieve the reward. The younger the child, the more frequent the rewards will need to be given. For children who want to stop, cover the finger or thumb with a Band-Aid as a reminder. Take the thumb or finger out of the mouth after your child falls asleep.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To help older children break the habit, you should try to determine why your child is doing it:<br />Find out what stresses your child faces and try to correct the situation. Once the problem is gone, your child often finds it is easier to give up sucking. If this doesn&#39;t work, there are dental appliances your child can wear in the mouth to prevent sucking. These appliances are cemented to the upper teeth, sit on the roof of the mouth, and make thumb sucking harder and less pleasurable.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Tongue Thrusting</h3>
                                <p>Tongue thrusting is the habit of sealing the mouth for swallowing by thrusting the top of the tongue forward against the lips.<br /> Just like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting exerts pressure against the front teeth, pushing them out of alignment, which causes them to protrude, creating an overbite, and possibly interfering with proper speech development.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Lip Sucking</h3>
                                <p>Lip sucking involves repeatedly holding the lower lip beneath the upper front teeth. Sucking of the lower lip may occur by itself or in combination with thumb sucking. This practice results in an overbite and the same kinds of problems as with thumb sucking and tongue thrusting. Stopping the habit involves the same steps as for stopping thumb sucking.</p>
