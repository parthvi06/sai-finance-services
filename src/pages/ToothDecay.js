                                <p>Every child is at risk of tooth decay. The enamel (hard outer layer) is much thinner and softer on baby teeth, making them at greater risk of decay. The good news is that tooth decay is largely preventable.</p>
                                <p>Baby teeth help children to eat and speak. They also guide the permanent adult teeth into position, so it is important to take care of your child’s teeth right from the start.</p>

                                <p>Bacteria in the mouth feed on sugars from foods and drinks. These bacteria produce acid, which damages the outer surface of the tooth (the enamel). Saliva helps to repair this damage, but if over time there is more damage than repair, it leaves a cavity or ‘hole’ in the tooth.</p>

                                <p>The tooth decay process is also called ‘caries’. In the early stages the teeth can develop white chalky areas. In the later stages, teeth have brown or black areas. The upper four front baby teeth are most commonly affected.</p>
                                <p>Other names used to refer to this condition include ‘nursing bottle caries’, ‘infant feeding caries’ and ‘baby bottle decay’. These names are used because the evidence suggests that early childhood caries can occur if babies and infants are settled to sleep with a bottle of milk or formula (or other sweet drinks). Milk can pool in the mouth and the lactose sugar in milk feeds the bacteria that cause decay as the baby sleeps. Saliva flow is low during sleep, and so does not protect against damage.</p>
                                <p>Early childhood caries might also occur if toddlers drink sweet drinks, such as fruit juices, cordials or soft drinks. Avoid sugary foods and drinks, especially between meals. </p>

                                    <li>a dull white band on the tooth surface closest to the gum line – this is the first sign and usually remains undetected by parents</li>
                                    <li>a yellow, brown or black band on the tooth surface closest to the gum line – this indicates progression to decay</li>
                                    <li>teeth that look like brownish-black stumps – this indicates that the child has advanced decay. </li>

At this time it cannot be reversed and the child may need major dental treatment. </p>

                                <p>Start teaching your child to drink from a feeding cup from about six months of age. By around 12 months, they should be drinking only from a cup. </p>
                                <p>For children over 12 months, water is the main drink. Plain full-fat milk is also a healthy drink choice. Children can drink low-fat milk from two years of age. Fruit juice is not necessary or recommended for children because of its high sugar content and acidity. </p>
                                <p>Children can start to eat solid foods from around six months of age. Offer a wide range of nutritious foods with a variety of textures and flavours. </p>

                                    <li>From 18 months to six years of age, use a small pea-sized amount of children’s low-fluoride toothpaste on a small, soft toothbrush. </li>
                                    <li>At six years of age children can use a pea-sized amount of standard fluoride toothpaste.</li>
                                    <li>If you live in an area that doesn’t have fluoride in the drinking water, ask your dentist about the right toothpaste for your child.</li>
