                                    <li>We want care givers to provide us with all previous dental, medical and social history.</li>
                                    <li>We want to create an environment conducive for the patient to receive care.</li>
                                    <li>We want to guide you with all the necessary knowledge and education and “how –to” regarding oral care for the patient.</li>

                                    <li>If a patient’s sensory issues cause the taste or texture of fluoridated toothpaste to be intolerable, a toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) to eliminate foaming nature, a fluoridated mouth rinse, or an alternative (e.g., casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate [CPP-ACP]) may be applied with the toothbrush.</li>
                                    <li>Toothbrushes can be modified to enable individuals with physical disabilities to brush their own teeth.</li>
                                    <li>Electric toothbrushes and floss holders may improve patient compliance.</li>
                                    <li>Caregivers should provide the optimal oral care when the patient is unable to do so adequately.</li>
                                    <li>We encourage a non-cariogenic diet for long term prevention of dental disease.</li>
                                    <li>We recommend Dental Sealants to reduce the risk of caries in susceptible pits and fissures of primary and permanent teeth.</li>
                                    <li>Topical fluorides (e.g., sodium fluoride, silver diamine fluoride) may be indicated when caries risk is increased.</li>
                                    <li>In cases of gingivitis and periodontal disease, chlorhexidine mouth rinse may be useful.</li>
                                    <li>Use of a toothbrush to apply the chlorhexidine is an option if caregivers are concerned about the child’s potentially swallowing the antiseptic.</li>
                                    <li>And lastly an increased recall frequency for patients having severe dental disease is indicated</li>

                                <p>The office staff under the guidance of the dentist will determine the need for increased length of appointment and additional staff to accommodate you in an efficient and effective manner.<br/>With the parent/caregiver’s assistance, most patients with physical and intellectual disabilities can receive oral health care in the dental office. Sometimes protective stabilization can be helpful for some patients (e.g., those with aggressive, uncontrolled, or impulsive behaviors; when traditional behavior guidance techniques are not adequate) for safe delivery of care and with consent. When non- pharmacologic behavior guidance techniques are ineffective, the dentist may recommend sedation or general anesthesia to allow completion of comprehensive treatment in a safe and efficient manner.</p>
                                <p>We will develop an individualized oral hygiene program that accommodates the unique disability of the patient.</p>
